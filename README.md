## TurningAndDirectionCorrecting


TurningAndDirectionCorrecting.c showcases diagnosing and trouble shooting a faulty motor. The motor on the robot here is slower than the one on the opposite side I  corrected this by using the gyro sensor to notice any drift, from there I sped up the one side that has the faulty motor to keep the path as straight as possible.
90 degree turns where the same. I had to have the left motor at a higher speed than the right. It still didnâ€™t work all that great at first, so I did a big quick turn until the gyro sensor reported it was within an acceptable range. From there I adjusted the turn slowly until the gyro sensor reported it was within +/- 5 degrees on either side of the expected 90 degree turn.


## LineFollowingAndObjectGrabbing


LineFollowingAndObjectGrabbing.c showcases detection and following of a complex line. It also took the concept of correcting the drift from my other project TurningAndDirectionCorrecting.c that had a faulty motor and built upon it using a proper concept of Automated Straightening using encoders. I have also modified all my 90 degree turn functions to use encoders instead of a fine/crude controlled turn using gyros that I had come up with in a simalar fashion to the drift correcting concept I had come up with while troubleshooting. This project Starts in a black box and needs to find a line, follow it, grab an object at the end of the line, and return back down the line to the start location and drop the object.
